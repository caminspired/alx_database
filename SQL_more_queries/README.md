**SQL - MORE QUERIES (PROJECT 20 | WEEK 10)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about databases, how to install MYSQL, and how to write scripts.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we will be learning how to install my MYSQL, write scripts to show, create and modify databases.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. My privileges!(4pts)
1. Root user(2pts)
2. Read user(6pts)
3. Always a name(6pts)
4. ID can't be null(6pts)
5. Unique ID(6pts)
6. States table(6pts)
7. Cities table(6pts)
8. Cities of California(6pts)
9. Cities by States(6pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION
